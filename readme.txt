<To test how the model works>

Run the "gridtask_SRIR_viewsaveall.m" function. For example,
Out = gridtask_SRIR_viewsaveall([0.6 0.4 0.05],[0.4 0.6],5,0.7,500,500,9,0.6,1);
The input and output variables are explained in the function file itself
and also in "gridtask_SRIR.m".


<To generate the figures presented in the manuscript>

(1) Run the following files to generate and save the data for the figures
(Note: data generated by "prepare_for_figure5.m" is large, ~2GB)
prepare_for_figure3_4.m
prepare_for_figure5.m
prepare_for_figure6A.m
prepare_for_figure6B.m

(2) Run the following files to generate the figures
make_figure3_4_6.m
make_figure5.m
make_figure7.m

(Note: The other files (function m-files) are called in the files listed above.)
